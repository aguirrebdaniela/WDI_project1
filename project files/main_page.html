	<h1> Harry's Trivia </h1>
	<p>Instructions: 
		Pick a game mode! 
		In "1 player" mode, you will play against the clock. You have 5 minutes to answer as many questions as possible! <br>

		In "2 player" mode, you will play against another player and take turns on the keyboard. Pick a topic and a category (the higher the amount of points on each block, the harder the question). Once all the questions have been answered, the winner will be announced! <br>

		Have fun!
